    "> The data you will be using during this lab session are collected via Apple Watch wearable device as well as labeled sleep scored from gold-standard polysomnography. Data were collected from 31 subjects in total at the University of Michigan from June 2017 to March 2019. Subjects wore an Apple Watch for 7 - 14 days to collect their ambulatory steps. On the last day, they spent the night in the lab for an eight hour sleep opportunity, and acceleration and heart rate from their Apple Watch while they slept were recorded. If any of you have any interest to see sample code on how to access these sensors on the Apple Watch, can find it [here](https://github.com/ojwalch/sleep_accel). The following types of data are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **motion (acceleration):**  date (in seconds since PSG start), x acceleration (in g), y acceleration, z acceleration.\n",
    "*   **heart rate (bpm):** date(in seconds since PSG start), heart rate (bpm)\n",
    "*   **steps (count):** date (in seconds since PSG start), steps (total in bin from this timestamp to next timestamp)\n",
    "*   **labeled sleep:** date (in seconds since PSG start), stage (0-5, wake = 0, N1 = 1, N2 = 2, N3 = 3, REM = 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "For your information, apple watch uses a triaxial MEMS accelerometer that measures acceleration in the x, y, and z directions, in units of g (9.8 m/s2). Heart rate is measured with  photoplethysmography (PPG) (an optical technique that measures blood volume changes) on the dorsal aspect of the wrist. Raw acceleration signal and heart rate data are obtained from the device by creating a “Workout Session” and using functions built-in to the iOS WatchKit and HealthKit frameworks. For more detailed information/description of the dataset, please refer [here](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/12/zsz180/5549536).\n",
